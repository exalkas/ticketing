Container has everything required in order to run one application


Kubernetes is a tool that helps us run multiple (different) containers.
We need to configure Kubernetes and tell to it how to run cntainers and how we want them to interact between them.and interact with other containers

Kubernetes creates a cluster (multiple virtual machines together). Each virtual machine is called node

There is the Master program which does the job and needs some configuration

We need to create an image.
To create an image we need to create a file
Run the docker build command

// add these to the Dockerfile
FROM node:alpine (that is which image to copy)
WORKDIR /app (where to run the app INSIDE the container)
COPY package.json . ()
RUN npm install
COPY . . (copy everything from the source code)
CMD ["npm", "start"]

// add this to .dockerignore
node_modules

run docker build .  (this one creates the image. image is a private file system)
to create a tag (so you can use the tag as an alias): docker buid -t yourdockerid/tagname .

note down the image id

to run the container:
docker run imageid (e.g. sha256:3111db5785d27e384daf12cac5b98fd1dcc9a1cbdc352427e1efe5a7887078c0 ----keep the part without the sha256:)

to run a shell or any other command inside the container:
docker run imageid or tag -it andthecommand  (e.g. docker run -it exalkas/tickertsauth sh   opens the shell inside the container)

to see which containers are runnning:
docker ps

to execute commands on a running container:
docker exec -it idortag commandtoexecute

docker logs id/ortag

#to see which version of kubernetes you are running:
kubectl version 

# to configure kubernetes, we use kubectl

Many Nodes together are a cluster. A cluster has also a master in order to manage the nodes.
Node is a virtual machine that runs a container.

A node has a pod.
A pod could have containers or one container
A pod has also service?

Pods are being managed by what is called a deployment
Deployment monitors the identical pods and 
Deployment reads the configuration file.

Services provide an easy to remember url

Kubernetes Config Files
=======================
Inside config files we will define Deployments, pods and services using YAML. Services are called objects

to cinfigure kubernetes use YAML files. (Yet Another Markup Language)
